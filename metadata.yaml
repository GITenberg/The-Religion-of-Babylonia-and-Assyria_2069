description: Covering the five thousand years after the dawn of history, the pioneer
  Assyriologist illuminates the polytheistic beliefs of the people of the Tigris and
  Euphrates river valleys in this 1906 work. He shows that polytheism gradually became
  "leavened" with Judaism, paving the way for the adoption of belief in a single God.
